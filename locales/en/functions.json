{"functions_conclusion":"Each type of function in JavaScript has its purpose and situations where it is most useful. Understanding these different types will allow you to write clearer and more effective code, choosing the form of function that best suits your needs in each case.","functions_declarations_explanation":"Function declarations are perhaps the most traditional way of defining functions in JavaScript. They are characterized by having a name and do not require assignment to a variable. A distinctive aspect of this type of function is that they are hoisted, meaning they can be called before they appear in the code due to how JavaScript interprets functions.","functions_declarations_title":"Functions Declarations","functions_introduction":"Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They are defined once and can be invoked or \"called\" as many times as necessary, which allows for code reuse and more efficient organization. Functions can receive data as input, called parameters, process that data, and return a result.","functions_name":"Functions"}
