  "control_strucutres_description": "Control structures are fundamental in any programming language, including JavaScript, as they direct the flow of code execution based on certain conditions or by repeating actions in a controlled manner.",
  "dataType_description": "The data type of a variable, on the other hand, defines the nature of the data that the variable can hold and the operations that are allowed with those data. Data types include categories such as integers, decimals (floating points), strings, booleans, among others. Each data type has a set of valid operations that can be performed with it, and the programming language uses this information to manage memory allocation and operations optimally.",
  "difference_between_var_and_dt": "First it is important to know what variables and data types are, since they are different concepts although closely related in programming. Here I explain the difference between a variable and a data type:",
  "operator_description": "In programming, operators are special symbols or keywords that instruct the compiler or interpreter to perform specific operations. They are fundamental for manipulating data and variables in any programming language.",
  "variable_description": "A variable is a container or storage in the `computer's` memory, identified by a unique name, used to temporarily hold a value during the execution of a program. Variables allow you to reference these values by their name to perform operations on them, modify them, or even pass them between functions. Essentially, a variable is like a box where you can store things (data), and you can change the contents of the box without changing the box itself.",
  "functions_description": "A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions are defined once and can be called as many times as necessary. This allows you to reuse code and break complex programs into smaller, more manageable tasks.",
  "methods_description": "A method is a type of function that is associated with an object (or class). In other words, a method is a function that belongs to an object. This means that the method usually operates on the data contained within its object.",
  "strings_manipulation_description": "Strings are sequences of characters used to represent text. JavaScript provides many methods to manipulate strings:",
  "arrays_manipulation_description": "Arrays are structures that let you store multiple values in a single variable. JavaScript offers several methods for working with arrays:"
