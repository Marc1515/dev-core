        Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code designed to perform a
        specific task. They are defined once and can be invoked or {"called"} as
        many times as necessary, which allows for code reuse and more efficient
        organization. Functions can receive data as input, called parameters,
        process that data, and return a result.
      </p>
