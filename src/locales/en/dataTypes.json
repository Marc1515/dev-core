  "description": "Data types in JavaScript are fundamental in determining how data can be stored and manipulated within a program. They provide a structure that helps the programming language understand what operations are possible with that data and how it should be handled. By defining data types such as numbers, strings or Booleans, JavaScript can optimise memory usage and operation execution, ensuring that interactions with data are predictable and efficient.",
