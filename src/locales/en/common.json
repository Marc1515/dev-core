  "javascript_definition": "It's an interpreted programming language primarily used on the client-side for creating dynamic web pages, enabling interactivity with the user, data manipulation, and more.",
  "variables_definition": "Variables in JavaScript are fundamental for storing and manipulating data within a program. They act as containers where you can store values, such as numbers, text (strings), or more complex structures such as arrays and objects. They allow code to be more dynamic and flexible, making it easier to perform operations, make decisions and control the flow of the program. In addition, the use of variables helps to make the code more readable and easier to maintain, as you can assign descriptive names to these data containers.",
  "datatype_title": "Data Types",
  "datatype_definition": "Data types in JavaScript are fundamental in determining how data can be stored and manipulated within a program. They provide a structure that helps the programming language understand what operations are possible with that data and how it should be handled. By defining data types such as numbers, strings or Booleans, JavaScript can optimise memory usage and operation execution, ensuring that interactions with data are predictable and efficient.",
  "operator_title": "Operator",
  "operator_definition": "Operators in JavaScript are symbols that tell the language engine how to perform mathematical, comparison, or logical operations between variables and values. They allow you to manipulate the value of data, compare data, or combine logical conditions to control the flow of code execution. These operators are fundamental to performing calculations, making decisions in code based on conditions, and handling the logic behind user interaction and system response.",
  "functions_title": "Functions",
  "functions_definition": "Functions in JavaScript are fundamental to organising and reusing code, allowing you to group blocks of instructions that perform a specific task. By encapsulating code in functions, you can call them at any time and from different parts of your program, which improves readability and maintainability. In addition, functions make it easier to break down complex problems into more manageable parts and can be designed to accept parameters and return values, allowing them to be flexible and modular. This approach not only saves time in coding, but also reduces the likelihood of errors by avoiding code repetition.",
  "methods_title": "Methods",
  "methods_definition": "Methods are functions associated with objects; they are essentially actions that objects can perform. A method can manipulate object data, perform specific calculations or tasks, and return a result. The main difference between standard methods and functions in JavaScript is that methods are bound to an object and usually operate on that object's data and properties, while functions are independent of objects and can be called globally anywhere in the code where they are available.",
  "control_structures_title": "Control Structures",
  "control_structures_definition": "JavaScript control structures are essential tools for managing the flow of code execution, based on conditions or repetition. They allow you to make logical decisions (for example, to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false) and to perform repetitive tasks efficiently (such as iterating over the elements of an array or repeating an action until a condition is met). Its use is essential for creating programs that adapt to different situations and input data, making it possible to implement complex logic in web applications.",
  "strings_manipulation_title": "Strings Manipulation",
  "strings_manipulation_definition": "String manipulation in programming involves altering or parsing text. This includes operations such as concatenating two or more strings, extracting specific parts of a string, replacing characters or substrings within a string, converting the string to upper or lower case, and searching for patterns within a string. These operations are essential in many software applications, from web form processing to report generation and database interaction.",
  "arrays_manipulation_title": "Arrays Manipulation",
  "arrays_manipulation_definition": "Array manipulation in programming refers to the set of techniques used to modify, inspect or process collections of data stored in array structures. Common operations include adding or removing elements, sorting and filtering data according to certain criteria, and accessing specific elements through their index. Modern programming languages provide a wide range of built-in methods to facilitate these tasks, allowing developers to manage arrays efficiently and effectively.",
  "syntax_and_basic_concepts_title": "Syntax and Basic Concepts",
  "syntax_and_basic_concepts_definition": "JavaScript syntax and basic concepts are fundamental to creating and controlling the functionality of web pages. They allow developers to write instructions that the browser can interpret and execute, such as manipulating HTML elements, reacting to user events and communicating with servers. Understanding these concepts is crucial for implementing control logic, structuring code efficiently and performing data operations, all of which are essential for developing interactive and dynamic web applications.",
  "dom_manipulation_title": "DOM Manipulation",
  "dom_manipulation_definition": "The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of the HTML document as a tree of nodes. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to modify the content, structure or style of the page.",
  "json_definition": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is language independent, although it is derived from JavaScript Object Notation, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON data."
