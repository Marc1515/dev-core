    "description": "Operators in JavaScript are symbols that tell the language engine how to perform mathematical, comparison, or logical operations between variables and values. They allow you to manipulate the value of data, compare data, or combine logical conditions to control the flow of code execution. These operators are fundamental to performing calculations, making decisions in code based on conditions, and handling the logic behind user interaction and system response.",

      "title": "Main Function of Operators",
      "description": "The primary function of operators is to allow the execution of mathematical, logical, comparison, assignment, and other operations on variables and values. This includes everything from basic operations like addition and subtraction to more complex operations like bit manipulation or logical comparisons. For example, in a program calculating the total of a purchase, arithmetic operators would be used to add up the prices of the products."
