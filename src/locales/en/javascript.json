They allow developers to write instructions that the browser can interpret and execute, such as manipulating HTML elements, reacting to user events and communicating with servers. Understanding these concepts is crucial for implementing control logic, structuring code efficiently and performing data operations, all of which are essential for developing interactive and dynamic web applications."
